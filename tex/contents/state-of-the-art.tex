Here, we will show what's the state-of-the-art regarding requirements definition. This is an important step in Software Engineering, or any Engineering.

\subsection{What is DevOps?}
\label{state-of-the-art:ss:what-is-devops}

The \textit{portmanteau} of Development and Operations - DevOps - is as "(...) a set of practices intended to reduce the time between committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production, while ensuring high quality", according to \parencite{bass_weber_zhu_2015}. There are, therefore, three things to retain from this definition. The two time periods where Development and Deployment occur, the quality of the changes to be committed to a system and the quality of the processes of putting those changes into production.
